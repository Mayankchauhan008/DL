# Deep Learning Implementations

A collection of Jupyter Notebook implementations of classic and modern convolutional neural network architectures, including AlexNet, LeNet-5, GoogLeNet, and examples of transfer learning using images like cats, dogs, and versicolor (perhaps from iris datasets).

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview

This repository includes:

- **`LeNet_5_Implimentation.ipynb`** â€“ Implements the classic LeNet-5 architecture for handwritten digit recognition.
- **`AlexNet_Implimentation.ipynb`** â€“ Demonstrates the AlexNet model, leveraging deeper architecture and ReLU activations.
- **`GoogLeNet_Implementation.ipynb`** â€“ Explores the inception modules of the GoogLeNet (Inception) architecture.
- **`Transfer_Learning.ipynb`** â€“ Shows how to apply transfer learning on pre-trained networks to classify images of cats, dogs, or other categories.
- **`DL1.ipynb`** to **`DL5_CNN_Model.ipynb`** â€“ Sequential explorations and incremental build-ups of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, culminating in the final CNN model (`DL5_CNN_Model.ipynb`).
- **Image assets**:
  - `cat.avif`, `dog.jpeg`, `versicolor.jpeg` â€“ Sample images used across notebooks for demonstration.
