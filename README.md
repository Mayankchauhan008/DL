# DL: Deep Learning Implementations

A curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks showcasing classic convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures and deep learning workflowsâ€”from building models from scratch to applying transfer learning on image datasets.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview

- `LeNet_5_Implimentation.ipynb` â€“ Implementation of the classic LeNet-5 CNN (commonly used for MNIST digit classification).
- `AlexNet_Implimentation.ipynb` â€“ Implementation of AlexNet, demonstrating deeper CNN architecture with ReLU, dropout, and normalization.
- `GoogLeNet_Implementation.ipynb` â€“ Explores the inception-based GoogLeNet architecture.
- `Transfer_Learning.ipynb` â€“ Demonstrates how to fine-tune or utilize pre-trained models for new image classification tasks.
- `Resnet_Implimentation.ipynb` â€“ Implementation of the ResNet architecture using residual learning (deep residual networks).
- `Inception_ResNet_V1_Implementation.ipynb` â€“ A hybrid architecture combining Inception modules with residual learning (Inception-ResNet v1).


- Sequential model development notebooks:
  - `DL1.ipynb`
  - `DL2.ipynb`
  - `DL3.ipynb`
  - `DL4.ipynb`
  - `DL5_CNN_Model.ipynb`
- Image assets:
